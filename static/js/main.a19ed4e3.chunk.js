It is said in the paper that empathetic individuals are able to foster the intimacy and trust that is critical to psychosocial mentoring. Also, providing mentorship can be incorporated into the mentors' sense of self (identity structure). Moreover, the research proved that psychosocial mentoring has longer duration relationship than career-related ones. In conclusion, it can be expected that once this app has the first mentor-mentee relationship, there would be a continuous cycle of mentor-mentee relationships. From the research, international student associations of each country in universities provide various information sessions and life mentorships. Therefore, collaborating with international student associations of each school, in the beginning, would make it possible to build the initial cycle.
